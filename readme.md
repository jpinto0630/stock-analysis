# Unit 2 Challenge - Stock Analysis 

## Project Overview 
A friend of ours named Steve recently asked us to help him analyze a portion of his parentâ€™s stock portfolio in excel utilizing VBA code. This latest iteration of the workbook is designed to run an analysis on the current data set and allows for future expansion as new data becomes available. 
## Results 
The analysis was performed on the data set provided by Steve which included stock performance for 12 stocks for the year 2017 and 2018.  
### 2017 
Our analysis shows that out of the two years 2017 was the better performing year. Out of the 12 stocks analyzed 11 of them had a positive return, with 4 stocks having over 100% returns for this year. 2017 had less total daily volume traded, however the discrepancy does not appear to be significant.

## 2018 
Inversely 2018 was the worse performing year out of our 2-year data set. Out of the 12 stocks analyzed 10 of them had negative returns for the year, we also observe that the two stocks that performed well both yielded over 80% return on investment. 2018 had more total daily volume traded, however the discrepancy does not appear to be significant.
